# Smart-Contract-for-NGO-Donation-using-Blockchain
This repository contains the implementation of a Smart Contract for NGO Donations, which enables users to make donations using cryptocurrency in a peer-to-peer manner. The project works on the principle of blockchain technology, which removes the need for a middleman like a bank or an agent, making transactions faster and more secure.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to enable users to make donations using cryptocurrency in a secure and decentralized manner. The blockchain network removes the need for intermediaries, making transactions faster and more secure. The use of smart contracts further enhances security by providing a programmable application that contains custom rules or logic acting as a virtual middleman.
