# Smart-Contract-for-NGO-Donation-using-Blockchain
This repository contains the implementation of a Smart Contract for NGO Donations, which enables users to make donations using cryptocurrency in a peer-to-peer manner. The project works on the principle of blockchain technology, which removes the need for a middleman like a bank or an agent, making transactions faster and more secure.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to enable users to make donations using cryptocurrency in a secure and decentralized manner. The blockchain network removes the need for intermediaries, making transactions faster and more secure. The use of smart contracts further enhances security by providing a programmable application that contains custom rules or logic acting as a virtual middleman.

## Features

Peer-to-peer transactions: Users can interact with each other directly without the need for a middleman.
Decentralized: The blockchain network removes the need for intermediaries, making transactions faster and more secure.
Immutable ledger: The distributed ledger is not easy to hack or tamper with, ensuring the integrity of data.
Irreversible transactions: Transactions using cryptocurrency are irreversible, providing a safeguard against fraud and account tampering.

## Working Principle

The Smart Contract for NGO Donations works on the principle of blockchain technology. The blockchain is a growing list of records that are stored in blocks that are cryptographically linked together. Each block contains a set of transactions that are accepted and appended to the blockchain, making them immutable and secure.

The blockchain is supported by peer-to-peer networking, which ensures that it is distributed throughout the network to each and every node, making it highly secure and reliable. The use of consensus algorithms ensures that every node carries out a series of checks before and after the addition of a new block to the network, making the blockchain network secure and verified.

Smart contracts are computer programs or transaction protocols that automatically execute, control, or document legally relevant events and actions according to the terms of a contract or agreement. The use of smart contracts enhances security by providing a programmable application that contains custom rules or logic acting as a virtual middleman.
